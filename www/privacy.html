   </h1> 
   <p>
    Welcome to Improove, a community to learn new skills from anyone. The Improove service includes all websites, mobile applications, and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the “Services”) are owned, operated and distributed by Giuseppe Trapasso and Mattia Mazzella (referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Improove” or “we” and through similar words such as “us,” “our,” etc.). By accessing any part of the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (this “Privacy Policy”) and the terms and conditions of our terms of service (the “Terms of Service”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services. This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of Improove. 
<br>
We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email. By accessing the Services at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated policy. This Privacy Policy was last modified as of August 18, 2021.

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
    Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as defined below). The following outlines our privacy policy.
</p>
<h2>
    EU Personal Data
</h2>
<p>
    If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice below.
</p>
<h2>
    Personal Data
</h2>
<p>
    When your register with us and become an Improove Member, when you choose to teach or attend a training, we will ask you for Personal Data. “Personal Data” refers to information about you that can be used to contact or individually identify you. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. 
    <br>
    In order to send you an email from Improovee, we need your email address. To provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, general location, and telephone number. We may give some or all of this information to the trainers for training that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their training. We will not give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. We may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others
    We may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.
</p>
<h2>
    Voluntary Disclosure
</h2>
<p>
    Any Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason. Your profile pages (“Profile”) and any online training you participate in are typically publicly available. If you need assistance with controlling your account privacy settings or with deleting content, please contact us at help@improove.com. Removal of posted content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information (e.g., some content may be “invisible” to other users but remain on our servers in some form). You should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via these or any other public venues.
</p>
<h2>
    Third Party Advertising
</h2>
<p>
    We use third-party providers, including Facebook and Google AdWords, to advertise the Services across the internet. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and display targeted ads to you. We only work with providers who undertake not to provide advertising to persons under 18 years of age.
<br>
A cookie is used to indicate to other websites that you visited a particular page and allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you. This cookie does not in any way give access to your computer or mobile device.
<br>
If you do not wish to see ads from us, you can opt-out in several ways:
<ol>
    <li>
        Opt-out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads" rel="noreferrer">Ads Settings</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Opt-out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</a>.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<h2>
    Other Sites
</h2>
<p>
    The Services may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it before providing any Personal Data. 
</p>
<h2>
    Trainers
</h2>
<p>
    As discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the trainers for training that you sign up for (‘Trainers’) so that they can coordinate their training. As part of our Terms of Use, Improove Traininers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data. Abuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Trainers' Class. However, please understand that Improove Trainers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not a party to any transaction between you and the Trainer. As a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.
</p>
<h2>
    EU Privacy Notice

Improove will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.
