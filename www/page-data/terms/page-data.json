By enrolling in training on Improove, a user grants us permission to share that user’s information with the trainer. The trainer is required to respect the privacy of the user. The trainer has a limited license to use this information only for Improove-related communications or for Improove-facilitated transactions. The trainer may use that personal information for no other purpose, such as sending unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions.  Remember that you need to comply with all relevant legal rules when you use Improove. This includes applicable data protection and privacy laws which govern the ways in which you can use another Improove user’s information.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Teaching or Participating in a Class\n</h3>\n<p>\n  To the fullest extent permitted by law, you hereby release Improove and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates and their respective successors and assigns from any claims or damages of any kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, relating to any dispute relating to the class agreements or any transaction or attempted transaction with another user of the service (whether a user or trainer). \n  <br>\n  Your training or participation in a training course is at your sole risk. Improove does not supervise trainings and is not involved in any way with the actions of any individuals (whether users or trainers) at any course. As a result, we have no control over the identity or actions of the individuals who are present at these trainings, and we request that our users exercise caution and good judgment when participating in Trainings. You acknowledge and agree that by participating in any training (whether as a user or trainer) you may be exposed to a variety of risks and hazards, which may or may not be foreseen, including (without limitation) personal injury, property damage and death. You are solely responsible for all costs and/or risks associated with your participation in any training.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Membership Fees\n</h3>\n<p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n    Improove collects all fees and may also pay out all trainers through third-party providers.

Under the Premium Referral Program, you will receive an award for each new user that visits Improove through your unique referral link and pays for their first month (or year) of Premium Membership. The value of your award is the 40% of the fee payed by the user on his first subscription. Award payments are subject to forfeiture or clawback if the user disputes the credit card charge or otherwise violates the payment terms, or if the trainer is found to be in violation of our terms. You will receive this reward within 50 days of the user paying for Premium Membership.\n  <br>\n  In order to receive a Premium Referral Award, each of the following requirements must be met: (i) you must own your Improove “Referral Code”; (ii) you must share the Referral Code with friends, family, and followers; (iii) a user who uses your Referral Code must create a Improove account and make his first Membership payment.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Cancellations and Refunds\n</h3>\n<p>\n  Improove is not responsible or liable for any refunds for Membership, or other purchases on the Service.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Improove Membership\n</h3>\n<p>\n  You may participate in our “Improove Membership” by subscribing to pay monthly or annual membership fees for unlimited access to our “Trainings”.

Improove reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.\n  <br>\n  For some trials, we will require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. At the end of such trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the applicable paid subscription on the first day following the end of the trial on a recurring monthly or annual basis. When you provide a Payment Method, we will attempt to verify the information you entered by processing an authorization hold. We do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold, but your available balance or credit limit may be reduced. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the trial, you agree to this charge using such payment details. If you do not want this charge, you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your payment settings within your Skillshare account profile or in your Play Store or Apple Store depending on your device.\n</p>\n<h3>\n  Price Changes\n</h3>\n<p>\n  We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service, or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
